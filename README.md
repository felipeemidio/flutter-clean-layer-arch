Flutter Clean Layer Architecture
Clean architecture proposal for Flutter (maybe Dart) development.

Introduction
Define a good architecture to your project is a survival matter. Most of the decision should be taken on early stages of the system design. Injection dependency, readability, maintainability, security and so many other concepts being anlyzed when we don't have the project's design fully completed can be confusing.

I expect from this proposal to be a good base for your projects to evolve sustainably. It is of my interest put as much information I can on each step, concept or stage.

Big Picture
THe project should be separated on layer format.

Reference
Th main reference to this proposal is Flutterando's proposal.
